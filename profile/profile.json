Implemented the application using JavaScript, Node.js, Express-Handlebars, CSS, Visual Studio Code, MongoDB, and Heroku. The application uses the MVC(model-view-controller) design pattern that specifies an application consists of a data model, presentation information, and control information. Node.js and express libraries are used to handle the Back-End applications. CSS is used to govern the front-end design. Database managed utilized on MongoDB. Application deployed through Heroku by using GitHub connection.",

Implemented project using various technologies such as CentOS, Bash/Shell, Docker, RDBMS/SQL/PostgreSQL, Crontab, and Git/Git Flow. Bash commands were used to collect host utilization data, which was processed using Crontab. The monitoring agent servers will run within a CentOS 7 environment. The server will save host data (hardware specifications and resource use data) into the (RDBMS) Postgres Database, which is deployed through Docker. Completed implementation on the IntelliJ IDEA which is one of the integrated developer environments. Managed and deployed the project by using Git/Git Flow.",

Implementation was completed by using  Java 8, RDBMS(PostgreSQL), Maven, Docker, IntelliJ IDEA, and Git/Git Flow. The application utilizes data access objects(DAOs) and Repository Architectural Patterns also certain advanced JDBC principles. Implemented CRUD operations for multiple DAOs that tested on the SQL queries. Maven build automation tools were used to handle the project. Testing and debugging were performed on the IntelliJ IDEA.",

Developed the application using Java 8, Maven, Docker, IntelliJ IDEA, and Git/Git Flow. Application package tools managed by the Maven-based on the project object model. Docker handled deploying the application via Docker Hub. Using Java 8 Stream APIs and Lambdas were assisted in effectively managing the usage of memory. Testing and debugging were accomplished on the IntelliJ IDEA. Versions and collaborations controlled using Git/Git Flow."
