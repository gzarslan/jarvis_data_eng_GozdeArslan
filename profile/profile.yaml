# #Make sure you run this command prior to every profile pull request
# bash profile_app.sh
#
# #This tool will generate the following files
# ../README.md #overwrite your existing README

# profile.yaml
#
# This is the only file you should edit. The profile_app.sh will convert/render your profile.yaml into multiple formats for different purposes.

# YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data-serialization language (similar to JSON but more human-readable). It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

# profile_app.sh
#
# Usage:
#
# #download sample yaml file
# bash profile_app.sh init
#
# #Render/convert the profile.yaml
# bash profile_app.sh
#
# The script will execute the following components documented below.??
# YAML validator
#
# Yamale is used to validate the profile.yaml against the profile_schema.yaml.
#
# jrvs/yamale docker image is available
# Markdown
#
# render_mardown is a Python tool that renders the profile.yaml file into a markdown file. The rendered markdown file will overwrite the ../README.md which servers as the landing page for your Github.
#
# jrvs/render_profile_md docker image is available
# JSON
#
# mikefarah/yq docker image is used to convert the profile.yaml into a JSON. The JSON file will be consumed by the Jarvis consultant web app which allows Jarvis' clients to easily view all profiles.

# Build your profile Steps
#
#     Setup the profile tool in your Github repo by following the Quick Start
#         Edit the profile.yaml file from your favorite IDE.
#                 Please read instruction/comments from the template profile.yaml carefully
#                         Check your spelling and grammar through https://www.grammarly.com/ before each commit
#                                 Execute bash profile_app.sh (please make sure you execute this bash script before each commit)
#                                     Open a pull request that merges the feature branch into the master branch (yes, you can skip develop and release branches)
#                                         Senior developer and CSA will comment and review your PR.
#                                             You will need to update your profile.yaml file for each project as part of the project closing the ticket. (please make sure you execute this bash script before each commit)

#
#                                             A project/job description allows hiring managers to understand the followings:
#
#                                                 Context (e.g. web app for store owners, a mobile app for students, etc.)
#                                                     Technical keywords, such as language, frameworks, design, tools, etc. (e.g. Java, Springboot, Microservice, REST API, Hadoop, Spark, etc.)
#                                                         Results and achievements (e.g. performance improvement, award, product delivery, etc.)
#
#                                                         Please follow the simplified SDLC pattern that covers Design/Purposes, implementation/technologies, test (manual/unit/integration), and DevOps/Deployment to describe a project. Please see the sample description below.
#
#                                                         #Design/Purposes
#                                                         Developed an XYZ app in [programming language] which is used for blah blah.
#
#                                                         #Implementaiton/technologies
#                                                         Implemented the app with Spring Boot, JDBC, X, Y, Z, etc.
#
#                                                         #Test
#                                                         Tested the app with Junit, X, Y, etc.
#
#                                                         #Deployment
#                                                         Dockerized the app blah blah.
#
#                                                         #of course, the description should be in one line.
#
#                                                         For non-technical projects/jobs, you can focus on soft skills instead of technologies (e.g. agile/scrum, team collaboration, communication, problem-solving, etc.)

    description: "The Linux cluster Monitoring agent project contains solutions in the creation of infrastructure for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration(LCA) team in regards to server host monitoring. This infrastructure assists the team in examining host statistics and data usage. The monitoring agent servers will run on centOS 7 and will save host data (hardware specifications and resource use data) into the (RDBMS) Postgres Database every minute(Crontab). The LCA (Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration) team will be able to help servers in need by having records of each node and node monitoring systems.
