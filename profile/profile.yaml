summary: After working on several engineering projects that incorporated data-driven software tools, I determined to sharpen my software abilities to put my passion for the software and data industries to practical use. Along with this, I am a recent Seneca College Computer Science graduate. Throughout my studies, I have worked on a variety of projects in object-oriented programming, database management, and web development. Involved in and handled many team initiatives that aided in the development of various teamwork roles and leadership skills. Working as a software and data engineer or analyst position piqued my interest. I'm presently employed as a data engineer associate at the Jarvis Consulting Group, where I develop software applications using Linux, Java, and data communication tools while adhering to the Agile/Scrum techniques.

    description: "Designed a Linux cluster hardware monitoring agent to screen server host statistics and data usage. Implemented project using various technologies such as CentOS, Bash/Shell, Docker, RDBMS/SQL/PostgreSQL, Crontab, and Git/Git Flow. Bash commands were used to collect host utilization data, which was processed using Crontab. The monitoring agent servers will run within a CentOS 7 environment. The server will save host data (hardware specifications and resource use data) into the (RDBMS) Postgres Database, which is deployed through Docker. Completed implementation on the IntelliJ IDEA which is one of the integrated developer environments. Managed and deployed the project by using Git/Git Flow."

      - "Twitter App: Developed a Java Twitter application that allows users to create, read, and delete tweets by using Twitter REST APIs. The MVC (Model, View, Controller) design model was used to implement the application. Additionally, mainstream technologies such as Java and IntelliJ IDEA were used to build the application. The Dependency Management (DM) was implemented using the Spring framework, which was integrated with the Maven package management framework. The application was deployed using Docker Components and then uploaded to Docker Hub. JUnit and Mockito were ultimately utilized to complete the testing process." 
      - "JDBC App: Developed a Java Database Connection(JDBC) application that enables a connection between a Java program and a relational database management system (RDBMS). Implementation was completed by using Java 8, RDBMS(PostgreSQL), Maven, Docker, IntelliJ IDEA, and Git/Git Flow. The application utilizes data access objects(DAOs) and Repository Architectural Patterns also certain advanced JDBC principles. Implemented CRUD operations for multiple DAOs that tested on the SQL queries. Maven build automation tools were used to handle the project. Testing and debugging were performed on the IntelliJ IDEA."   
      - "Grep App: Reimplemented an application to search matching patterns within the files by using grep commands. Developed the application using Java 8, Maven, Docker, IntelliJ IDEA, and Git/Git Flow. Application package tools managed by the Maven-based on the project object model. Docker handled deploying the application via Docker Hub. Using Java 8 Stream APIs and Lambdas were assisted in effectively managing the usage of memory. Testing and debugging were accomplished on the IntelliJ IDEA. Versions and collaborations controlled using Git/Git Flow."

    description: "Designed a movie streaming website with features such as movie listings, searching, registration and sign-in, and purchase. Implemented the application using JavaScript, Node.js, Express-Handlebars, CSS, Visual Studio Code, MongoDB, and Heroku. The application uses the MVC(model-view-controller) design pattern that specifies an application consists of a data model, presentation information, and control information. Node.js and express libraries are used to handle the Back-End applications. CSS is used to govern the front-end design. Database managed utilized on MongoDB. Application deployed through Heroku by using GitHub connection."
