# Gozde Arslan . Jarvis Consulting

After working on several engineering projects that incorporated data-driven software tools, I determined to sharpen my software abilities to put my passion for the software and data industries to practical use. Along with this, I am a recent Seneca College Computer Science graduate. Throughout my studies, I have worked on a variety of research projects in object-oriented programming, database management, and web development. Involved in and handled many team initiatives that aided in the development of various teamwork roles and leadership skills. Working as a software and data engineer or analyst position piqued my interest. I'm presently employed as a data engineer associate at the Jarvis Consulting Group, where I develop software applications using Linux and Java tools while adhering to the Agile/Scrum techniques.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_GozdeArslan](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_GozdeArslan)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_GozdeArslan/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed a Linux cluster hardware monitoring agent to screen server host statistics and data usage. Implemented project using various technologies such as CentOS, Bash/Shell, Docker, RDBMS/SQL/PostgreSQL, Crontab, and Git/Git Flow. Bash commands were used to collect host utilization data, which was processed using Crontab. The monitoring agent servers will run within a CentOS 7 environment. The server will save host data (hardware specifications and resource use data) into the (RDBMS) Postgres Database, which is deployed through  Docker. Completed implementation on the IntelliJ IDEA which is one of the integrated developer environments. Managed and deployed the project by using Git/Git Flow. 

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_GozdeArslan/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  -  Twitter App: Currently working on the project
  -  JDBC App: Developed a Java Database Connection(JDBC) application that enables a connection between a Java program and a relational database management system (RDBMS).  Implementation was completed by using  Java 8, RDBMS(PostgreSQL), Maven, Docker, IntelliJ IDEA, and Git/Git Flow.  The application utilizes data access objects (DAOs) and Repository Architectural Patterns also certain advanced JDBC principles. Implemented CRUD operations for multiple DAOs that tested on the SQL queries. Maven build automation tools were used to handle the project. Testing and debugging were performed on the IntelliJ IDEA.
  -  Grep App: Reimplemented an application to search matching patterns within the files by using grep commands. Developed the application using Java 8, Maven, Docker, IntelliJ IDEA, and Git/Git Flow. Application package tools managed by the Maven-based on the project object model. Docker handled deploying the application via Docker Hub. Using Java 8 Stream APIs and Lambdas were assisted in effectively managing the usage memory. Testing and debugging were accomplished on the IntelliJ IDEA. Versions and collaborations controlled using Git /Git Flow.


## Highlighted Projects
**Web App for Movie Streaming** [[GitHub](https://github.com/gzarslan/A-movie-website)]: Designed a movie streaming website with features such as movie listings, searching, registration and sign-in, and purchase. The project involves Back-End and Front-End applications. Multiple technologies are used when implementing that are JavaScript, Node.js, Express-Handlebars, CSS, Visual Studio Code, MongoDB, and Heroku. The application uses the MVC( model-view-controller ) that specifies that an application consists of a data model, presentation information, and control information. Node.js and express libraries are used to handle the Back-End applications. CSS is used to govern the front-end design. Database managed utilized on MongoDB. Application deployed through Heroku by using GitHub connection.

**A Retail Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/gzarslan/Database-3/tree/main/assignment2)]: Implemented a retail application that allows a user to add products to a cart for a specific consumer and estimates the overall cost of all the items. The order information is stored in the Oracle database after checkout. The project was developed by using the Oracle, PL/SQL, and C++ programming languages.


## Professional Experiences

**Data Engineer Associate, Jarvis Consulting Group (2021 - present)**: Developed, tested, and maintained various software applications and architectures as Data Engineer. Improved experience with  Java, SQL, Linux, PostgreSQL,  Docker, and Maven by applying the Software Development Life Cycle principles. Used Git and Git Flow to manage the versions of each project effectively. Collaborated with developer team by an Agile/Scrum Framework. Attended daily scrum meetings and sprint retrospective meetings.

**Project Data and Method Engineer, Jantsa Wheel Industry (2016 - 2018)**: Analyzed product data to create a new system automation project associated with production requirements. Using Excel formulas, tables, graphs, and macros, over 1500 products data were retrieved from ERP software into MS Excel to manage deviation and data regulations. Data components were used, product time measurements were taken, and statistical process control analysis was performed (SPC). On the based products, 70% of data variances were eliminated. Results and evaluations were presented to the project team as well as the managers, and an executive summary describing the values were written as required. Productivity was increased by 20%.
