# Introduction
- We have constructed a data analytics solution for the London Gift Shop (LGS) marketing team using Jupyter Notebook and Python in the previous Python Data Analytics project. The Customer Insight Notebook you created assisted the marketing team leading to enhancement marketing campaigns by providing vital customer insight. As a result, LGS decided to increase funding for the data engineering project and follow the same data approach across the board.
