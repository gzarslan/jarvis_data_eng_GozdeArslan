# Introduction
-The London Gift Shop (LGS) is an online seller of gift items based in the United Kingdom. A significant majority of the company's customers are wholesalers. Despite the fact that the company has been operating online stores for over ten years, revenue has remained consistent in recent years. The LGS marketing team aspires to better understand their clients and develop sales and marketing strategies by utilising cutting-edge data analytics. The CTO of UGS chooses to engage with Jarvis consulting software and data engineering services because the UGS marketing team lacks IT experience and the UGS IT department lacks the capacity to take on more projects. You'll be in charge of completing a proof of concept (POC) project that will aid LGS marketing by understand business purchasing patterns.
