# Introduction
- The London Gift Shop (LGS) is a gift-ware online company established in the United Kingdom. Wholesalers make up a large portion of the company's clientele. Although the company has been operating online stores for more than ten years, revenue has remained flat in recent years. The LGS marketing team aims to use cutting-edge data analytics to better understand their customers and develop sales and marketing strategies. Because the UGS marketing team lacks IT expertise and the UGS IT department lacks the capacity to take on additional projects, the CTO of UGS chooses to work with Jarvis consulting software and data engineering services. You will be responsible for delivering a proof of concept 
- (POC) project that will assist LGS marketing by evaluating customer shopping behaviour.
